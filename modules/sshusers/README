I know, I know. This is *not* the way to setup user accounts.

It's a proof of concept to setup local accounts and allow a
given public key to connect to them.

To create an account, first copy the public key into
files/public_keys/username, then define a user with

ssh_user { "username":
  comment => "U. Sername",
  uid     => 4566,
  group   => sysadmins
}

the 'sysadmins' group should exist.
