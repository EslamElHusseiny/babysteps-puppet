Setup local accounts with a given public key to connect to them.

To create an account, first copy the public key into
files/public_keys/username, then define a user with

@ssh_user { "username":
  comment => "U. Sername",
  uid     => 4566,
  group   => sysadmins,
  mail    => 'foo@bar.com'
}

(the 'sysadmins' group should exist).

We also set up a mail alias
(depend on Exec['newaliases'] defined in the root_mail module).

In your roles.pp (or nodes.pp), just have a line like

realise(Ssh_user['username'])

to have the user created.
