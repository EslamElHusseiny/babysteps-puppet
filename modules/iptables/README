(Very slightly) tweaked version of
http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/Recipes/ModuleIptables.

The idea is that each service that needs an iptables
rule calls ipt_fragment { "fragment_file": }
Puppet arranges for the line(s) in the corresponding
file to end up in the iptables ruleset on the node.

See file/fragments/* for the list of valid fragment_files.
