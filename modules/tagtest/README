This module is an experiment with Puppets 'tags' feature
(see http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/UsingTags).

Although I don't explicitly define any tags, each node will
gain tags for each node/class it inherits. This module just 
dumps a list of them to '/tagtest'.

XXX not doing what I want. Had hoped putting tagtest at bottom of
XXX baseclass definition would mean ssh, root_mail, etc. tags
XXX were all defined, that doesn't seem to be the case.
XXX Bet this is a inherits/include issue.
